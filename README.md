# X-Wing Dividers

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development notes

The data that populates the Gearbox is from `.\src\assets\ship-data.json`. This file is generated by running `node .\build\create_ship_data.js`. Running that
javascript file will combine the pilot information found in `.\submodules\xwing-data2\` along with the product information found in `.\build\ship-tokens.json`.
The `ship-tokens.json` is manually maintained in this respository. There's no easy way to figure out which pilots are available in which expansion pack, so the
aformentioned node command also generates the `.\build\ship-tokens-template.json` file which guesses and formats the list of pilots based on 
`.\submodules\xwing-data2\`. I then manually add new expansion pack products to `ship-tokens.json` based on data from [X-Wing Miniatures: Second Edition](http://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.wikia.com/wiki/X-Wing_Miniatures:_Second_Edition_Wiki).
